    steps:
    # Step 1: Check out the repository
    - name: Checkout repository
      # Use the official GitHub Action to check out the code in the repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      # This step allows subsequent steps to access files in the repository, 
      # including the Python script and JSON files.

    # Step 2: Set up Python environment
    - name: Set up Python
      # Use the official GitHub Action to set up a Python environment
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'  # Specify the version of Python to use
      # This step ensures the runner has the specified Python version installed.

    # Step 3: Install Python dependencies
    - name: Install dependencies
      # Upgrade pip, and install any dependencies required by the script.
      # If you add dependencies in the future, list them here.
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      # Currently, no additional packages are installed. If you need packages like `pandas`,
      # add `pip install <package_name>` in this section.

    # Step 4: Run the conversion script
    - name: Run conversion script
      run: |
        python obrada.py
      # This step runs the Python script (`obrada.py`) which:
      # - Processes all JSON files in a specific directory.
      # - Converts each JSON file to a markdown file with the correct timetable format.
      # - Saves the generated markdown files in a designated output folder (e.g., `timetables`).

    # Step 5: Create index.md for GitHub Pages
    - name: Prepare markdown file for GitHub Pages
      run: |
        # Ensure the docs directory exists
        mkdir -p docs
        
        # Move and rename Combined_Timetable.md to docs/index.md
        mv timetables/Combined_Timetable.md docs/index.md
            
    # Step 6: Commit and push generated index.md file to the repository
    - name: Commit and push generated timetables
      run: |
        # Configure Git with a default user name and email for the commit
        git config --local user.name "github-actions[bot]"
        git config --local user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
        
        # Stage the changes
        git add docs/index.md

        # Get build information
        RUN_ID="${GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER}"       # auto-incrementing number unique to each workflow run within the repository
        CURRENT_DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")    # Current date in yyyy-mm-dd format
        
        # Create a commit message with run ID and date
        git commit -m "raspored verzija - ${RUN_ID}, datum ${CURRENT_DATE}"
        
        # Push the changes back to the `main` branch
        git push
      env:
        # Use the GitHub-provided token to authenticate the push
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      # This step stages, commits, and pushes the updated markdown files back to the repository.
      # The `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided by GitHub allows the action to authenticate without 
      # requiring additional setup.
